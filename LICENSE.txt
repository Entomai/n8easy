Inspiration and Independence from n8n

The Node Automation Easy project takes inspiration from the open source workflow platform n8n, which is reflected in its name (“Node Automation Easy”). However, this project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or commercially associated with n8n.io or any other third‑party workflow automation platform. Node Automation Easy is focused on desktop automation (mouse clicks, keyboard input, local file operations, task scheduling), and does not include cloud/API integrations.

While some architectural ideas or coding patterns may resemble those found in n8n, the source code and logic in this project were written independently. We have taken care to ensure that our implementation and design are distinct, and any similarity is due solely to the inspiration rather than direct copying. Node Automation Easy does not commercialize or resell n8n; it is a separate, standalone tool.
